Formating USB partition & make a single Partition 

 Open terminal . Type the following -
  
  Sudo su (for geting the root previlage )
  'fdisk -l' or 'lsblk'  (It will show all your storage devices conected to your computer. like sda , sdb, sdc etc...)
   umount device location  (This will unmount the specific device ; for ex - umount /dev/sdb ) 
   parted /dev/sdb  (CLI version of gparted specify the drive linke /dev/sdb) Then a (parted) screen will apear
   mktable msdos   (It will make the partition table in this case we selected msdos means mbr partition table . In case of Linux you can also use gpt)   
   Type y for Yes; n for No
   mkpart primary 0% 100%  (single primary partition selected 0 to 100 %)
   quit  (all done let`s out of it)
   
Now Format the USB device :
  mkfs.msdos -F 32 /dev/sdb1 (or) mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb
 ( The format is done fat 32 & the location in the usb drive. )
 The format can be done in any type of system like NTFS , ext3 , ext4 etc.
